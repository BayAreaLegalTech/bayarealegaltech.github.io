As you have probably figured out, Bay Area Legal Technology, or BALT, is about legal technology...in the Bay Area.

This is an **informal meetup group** that gets together several times per year. Sometimes we meet at a bar and swap stories. Sometimes a law firm or company will host an event where people present their latest projects.

Everyone is welcome, as long as you conduct yourself civilly. Please see our [Code of Conduct](/conduct).

BALT in its current incarnation is a continuation of [Tim Hwang's group](http://www.robotandhwang.com/), which was active in 2011â€“2014.
